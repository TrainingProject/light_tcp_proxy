#   Light TCP Proxy
#
#   As its name, it is a light TCP proxy.
#
#   Now it is incomplete. But it is used to study Linux TCP/IP codes.
#   Because you could debug the codes in the user space.
#   There are lots of codes from linux kernel
#
#   Usage:
#   1. Add one rule into itpable like the following rule
#      iptables -t mangle -I PREROUTING -p tcp -s 192.168.1.104 -d 192.168.1.105 --dport 8080 -j QUEUE
#   2. Run ./ltp_main
#
#   Future Usage:
#
#   It is used to the network device, so it does not depending on any libarary even libc
#   Now it is based on the IPtables to get the packet from kernel.
#   It is easy to debug in this way.
#   But it will be could be ported into kernel easily
